In this folder, you will find samples of Kusto Query Language (KQL) for each type of signal that is sent to Application Insights.

# Usage of Kusto Queries
You can use Kusto queries as the data source in a number of places. E.g.
* the Logs part of Application Insights in the Azure portal
* PowerBI reports
* Azure Monitor Alerts
* Azure Dashboards
* Jupyter Notebooks (with the Kqlmagic extension)

# KQL editors and clients
You can write and execute KQL in various tools. E.g.
* [Kusto Explorer (desktop application)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/tools/kusto-explorer). Here is [How to connect to Application Insights in Kusto Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/query-monitor-data)
* In a Jupyter notebook hosted in [Azure Data Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/AppInsights/TroubleShootingGuides#what-is-azure-data-studio)
* In a Jupyter notebook hosted in Visual Studio Code (with the Python and Jupyter Notebooks extensions installed)
* Application Insights portal (Under *Logs* in the *Monitoring* menu)
* PowerShell (using the REST api). See an example here: https://demiliani.com/2020/12/16/using-powershell-to-retrieve-your-dynamics-365-business-central-telemetry/
