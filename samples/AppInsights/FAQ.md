# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How do I get started?
Business Central can send telemetry to one or more **Azure Application Insights** (Application Insights) accounts.
The first step thus is for you to create an Application Insights account.
See [HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-telemetry) for instructions on how to do that.

Once you have created the Application Insights account, make a note of the *instrumentation key*.

The next step depends on whether you are an ISV or a VAR:
* If you are an **ISV**, you must specify the instrumentation key in your app.json file. Once the app is installed in a Business Central environment, telemetry relating to your app will start to flow into your Application Insights account.

* If you are a **VAR**, you must enter the instrumentation key in the Business Central Admin Center of your customer(s). Once you have done that, telemetry relating to your customers will start to flow into your Application Insights account. You can also set the instrumentation key using the Business Central Administration Center API.

## What does it cost?
Application Insights is billed based on the volume of telemetry data that your application sends. Currently, the first 5 GB of data per month is free. Regarding data retention, every GB of data ingested can be retained at no charge for up to first 90 days.

Please check the documentation <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/monitor/> for up-to-date information on pricing.

Azure monitor alerts are billed separately.

Here is a quote from a partner using telemetry:
_We have been using telemetry for some months now and have enabled 20+ apps as well as environment data from dev systems and build pipelines. Last month we ingested 800+ traces that corresponded to 2.3GB of data. Eventually we might hit some of those thresholds, but then we can decide if we want to spend money on telemetry (probably will) and how much. With our current setup, we will probably limit ingestion and once that no longer suffices, we will add sampling to the mix._

## How can I reduce cost?
To reduce ingestion cost, you can
* set limits on daily data ingestion
* reduce data ingestion by sampling to only ingest a percentage of the inbound data (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling#ingestion-sampling)
* set alerts on cost thresholds being exceeded to get notified if this happens

Use this KQL query [MonthlyIngestion.kql](KQL/Queries/MonthlyIngestion.kql) to see the data distribution of different event ids in your telemetry database.

## Where can I learn more about Kusto Query Language (KQL) and Azure Data Studio?
Please visit the [KQL README page](KQL/README.md) for learning resources on KQL and the [Trouble Shooting Guides README page](TroubleShootingGuides/README.md) for learning resources on Azure Data Studio.

## How can I see what data is available in my Application Insights subscription
Use this KQL query [AvailableSignal.kql](KQL/Queries/AvailableSignal.kql) to see if you have any data in your telemetry database, and also what kind of signal is present.

## I deployed Azure dashboards, but they show no data
If you have data present in Application Insights, please check the setting in the *Time range* selector on the  dashboard:

## What is the data retention policy in Application Insights?
The default retention for Application Insights resources is 90 days. Different retention periods can be selected for each Application Insights resource. The full set of available retention periods is 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, 365, 550 or 730 days.

See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/pricing#change-the-data-retention-period> 

## How do I delete data from Application Insights?
Purge data in an Application Insights component by a set of user-defined filters.

See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/application-insights/components/purge#examples> 

## Can I grant read-only access to Application Insights?
To grant a person read-only access to Application Insights, go to the Access control (IAM) page in the Application Insights portal, and then add the role assignment "Reader" to the person. 

You might also need to add the role assignment "Reader" to the person on the Resource Group for the Application Insights subscription.

## What about Privacy regulations such as GDPR?
The Business Central service does not emit any End User Identifiable Information (EUII) to Application Insights. So the telemetry is born GDPR compliant. The service only emits data that is classified as either System Metadata or Organization Identifiable Information (OII). The meaning of these classifications are described here: [DataClassification Option Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/dataclassification/dataclassification-option)

## Will you backport the Application Insights instrumentation to versions prior to 15.0?
It took a lot of refactoring in the server and client to make this happen. So it is unlikely that we will backport the Application Insights instrumentation to versions prior to 15.0.

For each new signal type we add, we try to backport to the current major release (16.x right now) if possible.

For on-premises installations (private or public cloud), you can create an application/service that listens on the ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) events that we use for internal telemetry and then send them to Application Insights. Note that this approach is depending on internal telemetry events that might change and that are not documented by Microsoft.

This is documented here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tools-monitor-performance-counters-and-events and here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/monitor-server-events

See the Application Insights documentation for an introduction on how to emit telemetry from a .NET console application:
