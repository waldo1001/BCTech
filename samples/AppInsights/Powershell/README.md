In this folder, you will find samples that illustrate how you can query Azure Application Insights data using Powershell.

# Available scripts
This repository contains Powershell for 
* querying Azure Application Insights

# How to use the script
To use the script, do as follows
1) Go the Azure Application Insights portal, go to the *API Access* menu, and copy the application id and generate an API key 
2) Open Powershell and 
a) run GetTelemetryData.ps1 -appid <app id> -apikey <api key> -kqlquery <kql query you want to run>
or
b) pipe the content of a text file with a KQL query into the script: Get-Content <file> | .\GetTelemetryData.ps1 -appid <app id> -apikey <api key> 

Limitations: The current version of the script fails if either the KQL query only returns one column or one row. See comments in the code to learn more (and do reach out if you have a solution for this).
